# RestaurantRevenuePrediction

# Objective:

Predicting the revenues of restaurant (data from kaggle) This dataset provided by kaggle consists of only 137 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. The sample consists of 42 features and revenue value as the respose variable. The dataset consists of continous labels with some continuous and few categorical features. The challenge of this problem is to design a model that would train on very few number of samples but capable of predicting revenues of 100 times larger dataset.
